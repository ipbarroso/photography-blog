      <!-- TEXT ABOUT THE DAY -->
      <div class="post-body">
        <p>
          The first day was really good, maybe even beginner luck. I barely slept the night before
          because I was so excited to go to the park and take some pictures, but I had a few meetings
          in the morning so I had to wake up early. The meetings ended at 11 and by 11:15 I was out
          the door. I stopped at a gas station, got the best strawberry banana smoothie I have ever had,
          and headed to the park.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got there I found out I had to pay 2 dollars in cash to get in and of course
          I did not have any cash. I had to drive to a university ATM to withdraw money and since it
          was not affiliated with my bank I ended up paying 2.50 just for the fee. Worth it, I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I finally got back I asked the ranger for the best spots to see wildlife. He told me
          about a trail and said I might see some gators, which got me excited. I ended up seeing a
          bunch of them, including a gator mom with her babies, which worked great for photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also saw a couple of more experienced photographers at the park and made sure to ask
          for tips. One lady with her kid gave me some of the best advice she could and because of that
          I had an incredible first day with my camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt really good to be connected with nature again, headphones in, my music on,
          breathing fresh air. I think that feeling shows in the photos you see below.
