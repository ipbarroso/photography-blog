    <p class="equipment-intro">
      This is the gear I use to shoot the photos on this blog.
      Nothing crazy. For right now I don't think I need anything better.
    </p>

        <h3>Camera</h3>
        <p>
          Right now I shoot with a <strong>Canon PowerShot SX540 HS</strong>. It’s my first camera and 
          the one that started this whole thing. I picked it up with a good deal, and it’s been perfect 
          to learn on: light, reliable, and enough zoom to experiment with wildlife, landscapes, and 
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I improve, I might upgrade or add another body, I alredy feel kind of limited with this camera but I will do my research and see if there is anyting that fits me.

        <h3>Lens Filters</h3>
        <p>
          I’m starting simple here too. This section is for the filters I use to control light
          and color straight out of the camera since most if not all of my photos are not edited
          whatsoever. When I said I got a good deal I meant it, all the filters came with the camera
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>UV / protection filter for everyday use.</li>
          <li>CPL / polarizing filter for minimizing reflections.</li>
          <li>FLD / corrects color when shooting under fluorescent lighting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’ll update this as I test more and actually learn what they do.

        <h3>Accessories</h3>
        <p>
          Small things that make shooting easier and less stressful. As I said before... the simple stuff.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Camera strap that I can put over my neck</li>
          <li>2 Extra batteries and 1 extra SD card so I don't limit myself when I want to take photos.</li>
          <li>A small camera bag/case that came with the camera to carry everything on beach days, walks, or trips.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This page will change as my gear does. The goal is to keep track of what I'm using and inspire others to start.
