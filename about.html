        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey everyone! My name is <strong>Igor Barroso</strong>. I’m originally from Brazil but have been living in the US since 2016. 
          I’m currently a college student studying computer science, and when I’m not coding, I’m usually surfing, wakeboarding, or doing 
          anything sports related — and now, photography.
        </p>

        <p>
          I got my first camera on <strong>Wednesday, November 4th, 2025</strong> through Facebook Marketplace with a deal I couldn’t pass up. 
          It’s a <strong>Canon PowerShot SX540 HS</strong>. At first, I was a little skeptical about buying it because I tend to jump into hobbies 
          and sometimes lose interest after a few weeks. But this time, I sat down and made a list of when I’d use the camera and why I wanted it.
        </p>

        <p>
          My parents love to travel, and I realized that whenever we go somewhere new, I always end up taking tons of photos on my phone — only to 
          forget where they were taken or even the names of the places I visited. Sometimes I’ll look back at old pictures and have no idea where they’re from. 
          So I decided to buy a real camera, not just to match my love for being outdoors and exploring nature, but also to have a creative outlet that lets 
          me express a side of myself I don’t always show.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I thought, what’s the point of taking all these pictures if they just sit in a memory card? That’s when the idea for this blog came to me. 
          I wanted a place to post my photos, write about the experiences behind them, and keep track of the places I visit. It’s both a personal project 
          and a way to practice my tech skills since I’m building this entire site myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before diving in, I also made sure to figure out what kind of photos I wanted to focus on. I realized I’m most drawn to 
          <strong>wildlife, beaches, water sports, landscapes, and architecture</strong> — anything that captures the calm or movement of nature. 
          One thing I really love about photography is that no one is pushing me to do it. It’s something I get to do entirely on my own terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          So that’s how this started — a mix of curiosity, creativity, and a little bit of trial and error. I don’t have a fixed posting schedule, 
          but my goal is to share at least one post per week. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for reading, and welcome to the blog — the pleasure’s all yours 😉
